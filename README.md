Frontier Space - Project 2: Filter
<br>https://zhz1208.github.io/HER/

## The Concept
The site I designed for is my room in 855 Brannan Apartment. The filter is the window in my room. So, the window is a boundary between private space and public space.

With this kind of floor-to-ceiling window, residents inside have a good view of outside. Meanwhile, people outside also have a great view of inside. So, this raises the issue of privacy. 

## Site Archive
https://zhz1208.github.io/Things-Near-My-Window/

I have collected almost 100 things related to the site and arranged them in the order of their distances to the window. The one at 0 is the window in my room. The ones at negative numbers are things inside the window while the ones at positives numbers are things outside the window. 

## Version 1
I created a 3d virtual room to represent my room. People outside can “get in” from the window and visit the place.
