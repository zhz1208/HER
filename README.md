Frontier Space - Project 2: Filter
<br>https://zhz1208.github.io/HER/

## The Concept
The site I designed for is my room in 855 Brannan Apartment. The filter is the window in my room. So, the window is a boundary between private space and public space.

With this kind of floor-to-ceiling window, residents inside have a good view of outside. Meanwhile, people outside also have a great view of inside. So, this raises the issue of privacy. 

## Site Archive
https://zhz1208.github.io/Things-Near-My-Window/

I have collected almost 100 things related to the site and arranged them in the order of their distances to the window. The one at 0 is the window in my room. The ones at negative numbers are things inside the window while the ones at positives numbers are things outside the window. 

## Version 1
I created a 3d virtual room to represent my room. People outside can “get in” from the window and visit the place.

## Version 2
Based on the feedback, I added more personal items to make the room more “me”.

## Version 3

I made an interactive prototype. Visitors can interact with the objects in the room including tear down a page of the calendar, press the perfume, take a pudding or candy away, read the diary.

### Revised Concept
My concept was that people outside could enter my room and interact with the objects in my room. Thus, my room changes to a public space from private space. This concept is to amplify the phenomenon that the floor-to-ceiling window widely used in apartments brings the issue of privacy exposure.

I had spent time thinking about why people fear a loss of privacy until I read a viewpoint: 
> Meanwhile, the danger to us as individuals shift from privacy to probability: algorithms will predict the likelihood…

–Viktor Mayer-Schönberger in *Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think*

People may not care about exposing their privacy to the public but fear the public piece together the fragmented information and figure out who they are. That is the point of view my project will express.

Besides, after testing with several people, I found that the last version was quite like a game. It seems that I encourage strangers to enter my room and use my stuff. However, I didn’t mean that. So, I was considering how to distinguish it from a game. Then, I got inspiration from the work My Boyfriend Came Back from the War. The artist told a story by the website. I also would like to tell a story about me through my work.

So, I revised my concept that people outside can only see the objects in the room but can’t change the status of them such as take away anything or tear down a piece of paper. Based on the information they get, they can figure out the identities of the person who lived in the room and even predict her coming activities.

### Description
People will see a QR code on my window when they are outside of my window. By scanning the QR code, they can enter the virtual room. In this room, people will identify “who is she?”, “what kind of person is she?”, “what’s her life like?” and so on. Different people may find different clues in this room. Thus, they may reach different conclusions.
